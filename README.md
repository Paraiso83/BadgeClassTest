### There are A few TODOs in this exercises:

1. **app\\app.component.scss** / **app\\app.component.html**

   - Change the text _color_ of the **5th** input, inside the section `#container`, to red

2. **app\\app.component.ts**

   - Find a solution to show in the first input (`#lastBadgeText`) the last message sent to a Badge

3. **app\\time-counter\\time-counter.component.ts**

   - Define a return value `counter` so it can send information back to where the time-counter is used
   - Make sure that before the component is unloaded we clear the interval execution
   - Return the current timestamp in the `counter`

4. **app\\app.component.html**
   - add the return `counter` and write the value into the `#text7`

5. **app\\badge\\badge.component.html**
    - Uncomment `console.log`, evalute the issue that exists and find a solution for it
