### There are A few TODOs in this exercises:

1. **app.component.scss / app.component.html**
    * Change the text color of the **5th** input, inside the section container, to red

2. **app.component.ts** 
    * Find a solution to show in the first input (`#lastBadgeText`) the last message sent to a Badge

3. **time-counter.component.ts** 
    * Define a return value `counter` so it can send information back to where the time-counter is used
    * Make sure that before the component is unloaded we clear the interval execution
    * Return the current timestamp in the `counter`

4. **app.component.html** 
    * add the return `counter` and write the value into the `#text7`
